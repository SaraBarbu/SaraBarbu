🌍 Passionate about **cognitive neuroscience**, **neuropsychology** and **healthy and pathological aging research**





### 🎓 Academic Background  
-  **B.Sc. in Cognitive Neuroscience** – Université de Montréal  
  Specialized in neuropsychology, with a strong interest in  brain–behavior relationships and cognitive aging.

### 🖼️ Images10K Project  
Co-led with **Dre. Lune Bellec** as part of **Brainhack School 2025**, *Images10K* is an **open-source visual dataset** built to explore human object and animal categorization. The dataset was developed to study how people classify and interpret visual stimuli — topics relevant to **semantic processing**, **object recognition**, and **categorization research**.
